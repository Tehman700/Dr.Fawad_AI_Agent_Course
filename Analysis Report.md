### Question Analysis

**Question:** 
Infer a Java program using OOP concepts for the following scenario, we have concrete classes for real animals like Cow, Lion, Parrot, and Elephant. Each class implements the Animal interface, providing implementations for the `eat()`, `sleep()`, and `makeSound()` methods. These methods define the common behaviours of all animals. The Mammal and Bird abstract classes provide common properties and behaviours for mammals and birds, respectively. The main class Zoo demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating instances of different animals and invoking their behaviours. 
**CLO-1, C2**

**Analysis:**
- **Bloom's Level Identified:** The question requires application (C2) of Object Oriented Programming concepts, as students need to build a program using the OOP paradigm.
- **Comparison with Specified Level:** The identified level (C2) matches the specified level (C2).

**Conclusion:** This question is appropriate for the intended taxonomy level.

### Solution Analysis

**Solution:** 
The solution provided includes various components:
1. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes:**
   - Animal Interface: Declares common behaviors for all animals.
   - Mammal and Bird Abstract Classes: Provide common properties and behaviors for mammals and birds, respectively.
  
2. **Concrete Classes:**
   - **Cow, Lion, Elephant:** Implement the Mammal abstract class using `eat()` and `makeSound()`.
   - **Parrot:** Implements the Bird abstract class.

3. **Main Class:** `Zoo` demonstrates usage:
   - It creates instances of different animals and invokes their behaviors.

**Example Java Code:** 
The solution includes complete implementation of classes and methods according to the problem requirement.

**Rating:** 9/10

**Key Elements:**
- The solution accurately implements necessary interfaces and abstract classes.
- Fulfills all specified behaviors for each concrete class.
- Clear implementation of the main class demonstrating polymorphism and abstraction.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Documentation and Comments:** Adding more comments to the code would enhance understanding, particularly for beginners.
- **Additional Behavior:** Introducing more behaviors specific to each animal could increase the program complexity and educational value.

Overall, the solution is solid but could be improved by enhancing clarity and adding additional features for a deeper understanding of OOP concepts【4:1†source】.
