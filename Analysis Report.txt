# Lab Manual 10.pdf

To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided questions and solutions based on Bloom's Taxonomy and Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs), we will evaluate both sections as follows:

### Question Analysis

1. **Identify Taxonomy Levels**:
   - For each question, analyze the questioning techniques and determine the associated Bloom's Taxonomy levels (e.g., Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).

2. **Comparison with Given Levels**:
   - Compare the identified levels with the specified taxonomy levels. If discrepancies exist (i.e., if a question has a lower level than stated), we will suggest improvements.

3. **Improvements**:
   - Provide actionable changes to elevate questions to the required taxonomy levels along with example questions demonstrating the needed complexity.

### Solution Analysis

1. **Examine Solutions**:
   - Each solution will be reviewed to ensure it meets the expected Bloom's Taxonomy level as per its associated question.

2. **Rating and Feedback**:
   - Generate a rating (out of 10) for each solution, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses. If applicable, suggest areas of enhancement.
   - Provide clear guidance on how the solutions can be improved to meet the desired learning outcomes.

### Next Steps:

Please explicitly provide the taxonomy levels and CLOs associated with each question so that I can proceed with the evaluations based on the criteria outlined above. Alternatively, if desired, I can initiate a generic analysis using inferred levels based on typical educational practices.

I will start by evaluating the questions and solutions provided in the documents related to multithreading in Java. The analysis will follow the Bloom's Taxonomy level as specified.

### **Question Analysis**

1. **Question 01:** 
   - **Analysis**: The task is to write a program that generates random integers and processes them based on their parity. This involves basic programming knowledge and understanding of threads.
   - **Taxonomy Level Assumed**: Understanding/Analyzing level.
   - **Feedback**: This question might be at a lower level than required if you want students to engage in higher-level thinking, such as applying, evaluating, or creating. 
   - **Suggestions for Improvement**:
     - **Improvement**: Incorporate a requirement for error handling or extend the problem to involve synchronization issues in threading.
     - **Example Questions**:
       1. "Write a Java program that simulates a multi-threaded application where random integers are generated, and the program must ensure proper synchronization while accessing shared resources."
       2. "Develop a multi-threaded application that not only processes even and odd numbers but also implements a producer-consumer model, ensuring thread safety with synchronization tools."

2. **Question 02:**
   - **Analysis**: This question requires implementation of threading concepts by extending the Thread class and displaying output across multiple threads.
   - **Taxonomy Level Assumed**: Understanding/Application level.
   - **Feedback**: This question is suitable as it requires both understanding of threads and their practical application. 
   - **Recommendation**: Matches the expected level. No changes needed.

# Lab 12 (Open Ended) Solution.docx

I have extracted the content of the questions from the documents. Below, I will analyze each question based on Bloom's Taxonomy levels and provide insights on their alignment with expected learning outcomes. After that, I will review the solutions provided. 

### Question Analysis

#### Question 1:
- **Question**: Design a system for a university that offers various courses across different departments. Each course has specific attributes such as the course code, title, and instructor. Discuss how you would model the relationships between different types of courses using inheritance.
- **Assumed Taxonomy Level**: Likely at the "Analyze" or "Evaluate" level.
- **Analysis**: 
  - This question requires analysis of relationships among different entities which aligns well with higher-order thinking skills in Bloom’s Taxonomy.
  - **Improvement Suggestions**: 
    - To enhance the question if it seems too basic, you could ask for specific use cases or challenges in implementing the inheritance model. Example questions to consider:
      1. **Evaluate**: "Considering the potential future growth of course types, evaluate how your design could scale effectively by incorporating polymorphism."
      2. **Create**: "Design and justify a mechanism that allows dynamic alterations of course prerequisites as new courses are added."

#### Question 2:
